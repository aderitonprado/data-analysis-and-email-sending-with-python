## data-analysis-and-email-sending-with-python

Python project, where I analyze an excel database with more than 100,000 lines in a few seconds, I create a beautiful report and send it by email, all automatically, without any user interaction, without opening programs and your computer will stay 100% available to you.
 
## The challenge was to receive a database and return the following responses: 
- What sales per store did my company get?
- How many products are sold per store?
- What is the average ticket per product in each store?
 
## To develop this project, we use libs:
- pandas (1.1.5)
- openpyxl (v3.0.9)
- pywin32 (v302)
 
## install libs with commands:
- pip install pandas
- pip install openpyxl
- pip install pywin32
 
## Note: openpyxl version 3.0.9 (used in the project) does not support excel files in .xlsx format, only .xls. So if you have an .xlsx file, save it in .xls format and you won't have any problems.

## Requirements:
Outlook must be installed on the computer (just installed, it doesn't need to be open)

## Press play and let's go! 8-)
